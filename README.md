## Golf 2000 \*UPDATE \#2\*


</div>

### Description

This is the second update of my first Golf 2000, the

New Updates:

I changed around the tools in the course editor and added some more tools including a water tool with wave like ripples, I also made the ball grow bigger as it gets higher and then shrinks back to normal!!!

Old Updates:

This version has an animated moving ball and ball color selection in the main screen. In the custom course area I have added a "Fill Tool", Unlimited Undo's, and the loading automatically will find the hole and starting place from loaded in bitmaps, awesome update with all previous glitches known fixed.

This is great code, Just hope you like it, and if you do, please vote for me!
